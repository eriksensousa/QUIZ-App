QUIZ App
================

A QUIZ App made with Python is a program that allows users to take quizzes on various topics. There are many ways to create a quiz app using Python, and the specific details will depend on the developer’s preferences and goals.

- This is a quiz application based on Python. 
- This app requires graphical user interfaces like pygtk,tkinter,wxpython,pygt.
- This app contains an API which work on the above four mentioned graphical user interfaces.

USAGE:
To run quiz application in all toolkits,you must install all four toolkits. First run main.py using command python main.py,then select any option listed in it.

One way to create a quiz app with Python is to use the Tkinter module to build a graphical user interface (GUI) for the app. This allows users to interact with the app through buttons, text fields, and other visual elements. 

The project can be organized in a modular fashion, with different classes and methods handling different functionalities. For example, one class can be responsible for fetching questions from the Open Trivia DB API, while another class can handle the user interface and interaction. The Open Trivia DB API can be used to fetch questions and answers for the quiz, and the random module can be used to shuffle the order of the choices.

Another approach is to create a quiz app for the terminal using basic input and output functions. This type of app can be built iteratively by starting with a basic program that asks multiple-choice questions and checks the answers, then adding features such as improved usability, data storage, and expanded functionality.

Overall, creating a quiz app with Python is a fun and engaging project that allows developers to apply their knowledge of Python and its modules. The end result is a functional and entertaining app that can test users’ knowledge on a wide range of topics. There are many resources available online, including tutorials, code examples, and open-source projects, to help developers who want to create a quiz app with Python, including tutorials, code examples, and open-source projects. With some basic knowledge of Python and a bit of creativity, it’s possible to create a fun and engaging quiz app that can test users’ knowledge on a wide range of topics.
